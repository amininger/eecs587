# This project contains a version of blocks world that uses reinforcement learning for 
# move-block, which moves a block (moving-block) to a destination.
# The destination can be the top of another block or the table.
# 
#Changes to original blocks world code:
# 1. Remove P6, P7 in search-control
# 2. Add in RL-search-control rules - examples of both gp and template approach
# 3. Include initialization and RL-search-control rules for up to 4 blocks
# 4. Use ^name blocks-world on state for simplicity instead of problem space
# 5. Add in reward rules.
