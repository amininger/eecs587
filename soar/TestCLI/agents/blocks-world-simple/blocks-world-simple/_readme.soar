# This project contains a version of blocks world.
# All actions are "internal" using P10 to change the state when an operator is selected.
# 
# Uses two operator evaluation rules (P6 & P7)
#  These are sufficient to eliminate all search
# 
#Changes to original blocks world code as described in the Soar book:
# 1. Use ^name blocks-world on state for simplicity instead of problem space
# 2. Add initialization rules and goal detection rules that can be uncommented for
#    using 4 or 5 blocks.
