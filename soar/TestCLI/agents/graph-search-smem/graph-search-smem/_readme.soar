## Similar to graph-search.soar but uses semantic memory

## Has two different uses of semantic memory
##  1. Can hold its mission in wm or smem, which is a list of waypoints to visit. This works fine.
##             ^parameters.mission-storage [ wm smem ]
##  2. Can hold all of its waypoints in semantic memory or working memory. 
##     ^waypoint-storage [ smem wm ]
