## Incorporates both operator subgoaling/means ends analysis with reinforcement learning
## All search control knowledge (operator evaluation rules) are removed from 
## blocks-world-operator-subgoaling and instead there are RL rules supplemented with 
## rules to compute reward, both in the top state and the substate.
##
## Implemented for four blocks.
