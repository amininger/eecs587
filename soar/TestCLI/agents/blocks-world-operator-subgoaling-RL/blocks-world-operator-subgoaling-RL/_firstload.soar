### Blocks world that uses the selection problem space (from the default folder) to do 
### do operator subgoaling with means-ends analysis
### In this approach, operators are proposed if they reduce the different between the current state
###  and the desired state, even if they do not apply to to the current state.
### If they do apply, then forward progress occurs.
### If they do not apply, an operator subgoal arises and in the subgoal, the agent
###  tries to select operators that moves the agent to a state where the selected operator can apply.
