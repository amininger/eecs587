			     Goal Dependency Set

   The Goal Dependency Set is a data structure used in Operand2 to maintain
   the integrity of a subgoal with respect to changes in supergoal WMEs.
   Whenever a WME in the goal's dependency set changes, the goal is immediately
   removed.  The routines for maintaining the GDS and determining if a goal
   should be retracted are in decide.c

   Fields in a goal dependency set:

      goal:  points to the goal for which this dependency set was created.
             The goal also has a pointer back to the GDS.

      wmes_in_gds:  A DLL of WMEs in the goal dependency set

   The GDS is created only when necessary; that is, when an o-supported WME
   is created in some subgoal and that subgoal has no GDS already.  The
   instantiations that led to the creation of the o-supported WME are 
   examined; any supergoal WMEs in these instantiations are added to the 
   wmes_in_gds DLL.  The GDS for each goal is examined for every WM change;
   if a WME changes that is on a GDS, the goal that the GDS points to is
   immediately removed.  

   When a goal is removed, the GDS is not immediately removed.  Instead,
   whenever a WME is removed (or when it is added to another GDS), we check
   to also make certain that its GDS has other WMEs on the wmes_in_gds DLL.
   If not, then we remove the GDS then.  This delay avoids having to scan
   over all the WMEs in the GDS in addition to removing the goal (i.e., the
   maintenance cost is amortized over a number of WM phases).

                               Preferences

   Fields in a preference:

      type:  indicates the type of the preference.  This is one of the
             types defined below:  ACCEPTABLE_PREFERENCE_TYPE, etc.

      o_supported:  TRUE iff the preference has o-support

      in_tm:  TRUE iff the preference is currently in temporary memory

      on_goal_list:  TRUE iff the preference is on the list of preferences
                     supported by its match goal (see all_of_goal_next below)

      reference_count:  (see below)

      id, attr, value, referent:  points to the symbols.  Referent is only
                                  used for binary preferences.

      slot:  points to the slot this preference is for.  (NIL if the
        preference is not in TM.)

      next, prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of preferences of the
                   same type in that particular slot

      all_of_slot_next, all_of_slot_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list
          of all preferences (of any type) in that particular slot

      all_of_goal_next, all_of_goal_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list
          of all preferences supported by this particular match goal.
          This is needed in order to remove all o-support from a particular
          goal when that goal is removed from the context stack.

      next_clone, prev_clone:  used for a doubly-linked list of all "clones"
        of this preference.  When a result is returned from a subgoal and a
        chunk is built, we get two copies of the "same" preference, one from
        the subgoal's production firing, and one from the chunk instantiation.
        If results are returned more than one level, or the same result is
        returned simultaneously by multiple production firings, we can get
        lots of copies of the "same" preference.  These clone preferences
        are kept on a list so that we can find the right one to backtrace
        through, given a wme supported by "all the clones."

      inst:  points to the instantiation that generated this preference

      inst_next, inst_prev:  used for a doubly-linked list of all
        existing preferences that were generated by that instantiation

      next_candidate:  used by the decider for lists of candidate values
        for a certain slot

      next_result:  used by the chunker for a list of result preferences

   Reference counts on preferences:
      +1 if the preference is currently in TM
      +1 for each instantiation condition that points to it (bt.trace)
      +1 if it supports an installed context WME

   We deallocate a preference if:
      (1) reference_count==0 and all its clones have reference_count==0
          (hence it couldn't possibly be needed anymore)
   or (2) its match goal is removed from the context stack
          (hence there's no way we'll ever want to BT through it)
------------------------------------------------------------------------ */

/* WARNING: preference types must be numbered 0..(NUM_PREFERENCE_TYPES-1),
   because the slot structure contains an array using these indices. Also
   make sure to update the strings in prefmem.h.  Finally, make sure the
   helper function defined below (for e.g. preference_is_unary) use the
   correct indices.

   NOTE: Reconsider, binary and unary parallel preferences are all
   deprecated.  Their types are not removed here because it would break
   backward compatibility of rete fast loading/saving.  It's possible that
   can be fixed in rete.cpp, but for now, we're just keeping the preference
   types.  There is no code that actually uses them any more, though.*/

      all_preferences:  header of a doubly-linked list of all preferences
        currently in the slot

      preferences[NUM_PREFERENCE_TYPES]: array of headers of doubly-linked
        lists, one for each possible type of preference.  These store
        all the preferences, sorted into lists according to their types.
        Within each list, the preferences are sorted according to their
        match goal, with the pref. supported by the highest goal at the
        head of the list.

      CDPS: a dll of preferences in the context-dependent preference set,
        which is the set of all preferences that contributed to an operator's
        selection.  This is used to allow Soar to backtrace through evaluation
        rules in substates.  The rules that determine which preferences are
        in the CPSD are outlined in run_preference_semantics().

      impasse_id:  points to the identifier of the attribute impasse object
        for this slot.  (NIL if the slot isn't impassed.)

      isa_context_slot:  TRUE iff this is a context slot

      impasse_type:  indicates the type of the impasse for this slot.  This
        is one of NONE_IMPASSE_TYPE, CONSTRAINT_FAILURE_IMPASSE_TYPE, etc.
  
      marked_for_possible_removal:  TRUE iff this slot is on the list of
        slots that might be deallocated at the end of the current top-level
        phase.

      changed:  indicates whether the preferences for this slot have changed.
        For non-context slots, this is either NIL or a pointer to the
        corresponding dl_cons in changed_slots (see decide.c); for context
        slots, it's just a zero/nonzero flag.

      acceptable_preference_changed:  for context slots only; this is zero
        if no acceptable or require preference in this slot has changed;
        if one has changed, it points to a dl_cons.

   it points to the symbol referent of the test.  For other kinds of tests,
   bit 0 of the pointer is set to 1, and the pointer (minus 1) points to
   a complex_test structure.  (A field in the complex_test structure

        field tests for the condition.

      test_for_acceptable_preference:  for positive and negative conditions,

      data.ncc.top, data.ncc.bottom:  for NCC's, these point to the top and
        bottom of the subconditions likned list.
