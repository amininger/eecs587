                             symtab.h

   Soar 6 uses five kinds of symbols:  symbolic constants, integer
   constants, floating-point constants, identifiers, and variables.
   We use five resizable hash tables, one for each kind of symbol.

   "symbol" is typedef-ed as a union of the five kinds of symbol
   structures.  Some fields common to all symbols are accessed via
   sym->common.field_name; fields particular to a certain kind of
   symbol are accessed via sym->var.field_name_on_variables, etc.
   (See the definitions below.)  Note that "common" is #defined below.

   Some (but not all) of the fields common to all symbols are:
      symbol_type:  indicates which of the five kinds of symbols this is
      reference_count:  current reference count for this symbol
      hash_id:  used for hash functions in the rete (and elsewhere)
      
   Fields on symbolic constants:
      name:  points to null-terminated string giving its name
      production:  points to a production structure, or NIL if there is
                   no production with that name

   Fields on integer constants:
      value:  gives the value of the symbol.  This is of type (int64_t).

   Fields on floating-point constants:
      value:  gives the value of the symbol.  This is of type (float).

   Fields on variables:
      name:  points to null-terminated string giving its name
      tc_num:  used for transitive closure computations
      current_binding_value:  when productions are fired, this indicates
                              the variable's binding
      gensym_number:  used by the variable generator to prevent certain
                      already-in-use variables from being generated
      rete_binding_locations:  used temporarily by the Rete, while adding
                      productions, to store a list of places where this
                      variable is bound and/or tested

   Fields on identifiers:

       name_number, name_letter:  indicate the name of the identifier

       isa_goal, isa_impasse:  indicate whether this is the identifier of a
                               goal or attribute impasse

       isa_operator:  keeps a count of how many (normal or acceptable
                      preference) wmes contain (^operator <this-id>).
                      The tracing code uses this to figure out whether
                      a given object is an operator.

       allow_bottom_up_chunks:  Used for bottom-up chunking, and only on goal
         identifiers.  This is TRUE iff no chunk has yet been built for a
         subgoal of this goal.
        
       could_be_a_link_from_below:  TRUE if there might be a link to this id
         from some other id lower in the goal stack.

       did_PE: 

       level:  current goal_stack_level of this id

       promotion_level:  level to which this id is going to be promoted as
         soon as ownership info is updated.

       link_count:  count of how many links there are to this id.

       unknown_level:  if the goal_stack_level of this id is known, this is
         NIL.  If the level isn't known, it points to a dl_cons in a dl_list
         used by the demotion routines.

       slots:  this is the header for a dll of the slots for this id.

       tc_num:  used for transitive closures, marking id's, etc.
 
       variablization:  used by the chunker when variablizing chunks--this
         points to the variable to which this id gets changed

       impasse_wmes:  for goal and impasse ids only:  this is the header
         of the dll of architecture-created wmes (e.g., (G37 ^object G36))

       higher_goal, lower_goal:  for goals, these point to adjacent goals
         in the context stack
       problem_space_slot, state_slot, operator_slot:  for goals, these
         point to the corresponding context slots
       preferences_from_goal:  for goals, this is the header of the dll
         of all preferences supported by this goal.  This is needed so
         we can remove o-supported preferences when the goal goes away.

       gds: pointer to a goal's dependency set
       saved_firing_type: the firing type that must be restored if
          Waterfall processing returns to this level. see consistency.c
       ms_o_assertions:  dll of o-assertions at this level
       ms_i_assertions:  dll of i-assertions at this level
       ms_retractions:   dll of all retractions at this level

       associated_output_links:  used by the output module

       input_wmes:  dll of wmes added by input functions

   Reference counting for symbols:  I can't remember all the places I add
     reference counts to symbols.  Here's a bunch I can remember though.
     If you're not sure whether to add/remove a reference for something,
     it's better to play it safe and do the add/remove.

     +1 for each occurrence in a rete test or alpha mem constant test
     +1 for each occurrence in a condition test anywhere
     +1 for each occurrence in a Not
     +1 for each occurrence in a saved_test
     +1 for each occurrence in a WME
     +1 for each occurrence in a preference
     +1 for each occurrence as {id or attr} of a slot
     +1 for goal/impasse identifiers
     +1 if it's the name of a production
     +1 if it's a predefined symbol (e.g., "goal" or "operator")
     +1 for each enqueued add-link or remove-link to/from it
     +1 for each occurrence in a global var. (e.g., chunk-free-problem-spaces)

  We deallocate a symbol when its reference count goes to 0.

                       Symbol Table Routines

   Initialization:

     Init_symbol_tables() should be called first, to initialize the
     module.

   Lookup and Creation:

     The find_xxx() routines look for an existing symbol and return it
     if found; if no such symbol exists, they return NIL.

     The make_xxx() routines look for an existing symbol; if the find one,
     they increment the reference count and return it.  If no such symbol
     exists, they create a new one, set the reference count to 1, and
     return it.

     Note that rather than a make_identifier() routine, we have a
     make_new_identifier() routine, which takes two arguments: the first
     letter for the new identifier, and its initial goal_stack_level.
     There is no way to force creation of an identifier with a particular
     name letter/number combination like J37.

   Reference Counting:

     Symbol_add_ref() and symbol_remove_ref() are macros for incrementing
     and decrementing the reference count on a symbol.  When the count
     goes to zero, symbol_remove_ref() calls deallocate_symbol().

   Other Utilities:

     Reset_id_counters() is called during an init-soar to reset the id
     gensym numbers to 1.  It first makes sure there are no existing
     identifiers in the system--otherwise we might generate a second
     identifier with the same name later on.

     Reset_id_and_variable_tc_numbers() resets the tc_num field of every
     existing id and variable to 0.
     
     Reset_variable_gensym_numbers() resets the gensym_number field of
     every existing variable to 0.
     
     Print_internal_symbols() just prints a list of all existing symbols.
     (This is useful for debugging memory leaks.)
     
     Generate_new_sym_constant() is used to gensym new symbols that are
     guaranteed to not already exist.  It takes two arguments: "prefix"
     (the desired prefix of the new symbol's name), and "counter" (a
     pointer to a counter (uint64_t) that is incremented to produce
     new gensym names).
