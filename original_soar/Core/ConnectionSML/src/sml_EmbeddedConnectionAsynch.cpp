// EmbeddedConnectionAsynch class

// Author: Douglas Pearson, www.threepenny.net
// Date  : August 2004
//
// This class represents a logical connection between two entities that are communicating
// via SML (a form of XML).  In the embedded case that this class represents, both entities
// are within the same process.  For the "Asynch" variant, the two entities execute in
// different threads.
//
// NOTE: This class is VERY similar to the RemoteConnection class.  In fact we should
// probably fold them together at some point with a common base class.  But for now, be aware
// that if you're changing something here you should probably also be changing it there.
