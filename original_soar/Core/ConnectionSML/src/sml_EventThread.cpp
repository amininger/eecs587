// This thread can be used by a client to keep it alive to incoming
// events even when the main client is sleeping.
//
// Here's the problem situation: client registers for an event,
// goes to sleep somewhere (e.g. inside a keyboard input handler or
// a GUI event loop) and then another client runs Soar.
// The events from Soar will block when they try to contact the sleeping
// client until it wakes up.  This thread is one way to make sure the
// client remains responsive.

/*************************************************************
* @brief The event thread's logic.
*		 When this method exits, the thread shuts down.
*
* This thread is very simple at its core, it calls "ReceiveMessages()"
* in a loop forever.
*
* The complexity comes in from throttling this thread correctly.
* If the client is actively sending messages to/from Soar we don't
* what this thread to slow it down by polling for messages.
* Also when the client sleeps we don't want this to be polling so
* quickly that it eats up all of the CPU on the machine.
* But equally, if the client is sleeping and someone else runs the kernel
* and starts sending tons of messages we want it to be as responsive
* as possible during that run.
*
* So here's the current solution.  We use a mutex (m_ClientMutex)
* inside the SendMessageGetResponse() and ReceiveMessages() methods to make
* sure either this thread or the main client is sending/receiving.
* By putting this in "SendMessageGetResponse" the client itself will lock
* out this thread for long periods (e.g. during an entire "run" call).
* 
* Then when this thread is functional, it's either polling really
* fast (Sleep(0)) or pausing for decent spans (Sleep(5)) which
* will lead to close to 0% CPU usage when everyone is sleeping
* (empirical tests on my laptop show 0%).
