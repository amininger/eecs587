	// While this thread is alive, keep checking for incoming messages
	// and executing them.  These messages could be coming in from a remote socket
	// or from an embedded connection.  If we're executing on the client thread
	// for an embedded connection (the "sycnhronous" model) then this thread is shut down
	// and it's the client's responsibility to check for incoming messages by calling
	// "GetIncomingCommands" periodically.

	// Record the time of the last message we received and keep polling
	// for a little after at a high speed, before sleeping.
	// The reason we track this is because calling "Sleep(0)" gives us maximum
	// performance (on towers-of-hanoi calling Sleep(1) instead slows execution down
	// by a factor of 80!), but calling "Sleep(0)" means we're stuck in a tight loop checking
	// messages continually.  If we're using Soar through a command line interface (for instance)
	// then the CPU would be 100% loaded all of the time, even if the user wasn't typing anything.
	// This method of switching between Sleep(0) and a true sleep means we get maximum performance
	// during a run (when messages are flying back and forth) but when the user stops doing anything
	// the CPU quickly drops off to 0% usage as we sleep a lot.
	// The other option would be to have a notification system where we sleep until a command
	// comes in, but building that in a cross platform fashion isn't something we want to tackle right now.
