   For each production which is backtraced through, keep the name of the
   production, which condition was being traced (from the RHS of this
   production firing) and then the lists of grounds, potentials, locals
   and negateds generated during the backtrace.
   At the moment I'm not guaranteeing that each condition appears in the
   correct list -- this is because elements move between lists after their
   initial positioning.
