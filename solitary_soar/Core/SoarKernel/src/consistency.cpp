   This routine is called from the Propose Phase

   proceeds from top goal to bottom goal so the active goal is the goal
   highest in the stack with productions waiting to fire.  This procedure
   also recognizes quiescence (no productions active anywhere) and
   mini-quiescence (no more IE_PRODS are waiting to fire in some goal for a
   goal that fired IE_PRODS in the previous elaboration).  Mini-quiescence is
   followed by a consistency check. */
