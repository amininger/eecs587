		"\n"
		"Delta Bar Delta (DBD) is implemented in Soar RL as a decay mode. It changes the\n"
		"way all the rules in the eligibility trace get their values updated. In order\n"
		"to implement this, the agent gets an additional learning parameter\n"
		"\"meta-learning-rate\" and each rule gets two additional decay parameters: beta\n"
		"and h. The meta learning rate is set manually; the per-rule features are\n"
		"handles automatically by the DBD algorithm. The key idea is that the meta\n"
		"parameters keep track of how much a rule's RL value has been updated recently,\n"
		"and if a rule gets updates in the same direction multiple times in a row then\n"
		"subsequent updates in the same direction will have more effect. So DBD acts\n"
		"sort of like momentum for the learning rate.\n"
		"\n"
		"To enable DBD, use \"rl --set decay-mode delta-bar-delta\". To change the meta\n"
		"learning rate, use e.g. \"rl --set meta-learning-rate 0.1\". When you execute\n"
		"\"rl\", under the Experimental section you'll see the current settings for\n"
		"decay-mode and meta-learning-rate. Also, if a rule gets printed concisely (e.g.\n"
		"by executing \"p\"), and the rule is an RL rule, and the decay mode is set to\n"
		"delta-bar-delta, then instead of printing the rule name followed by the update\n"
		"count and the RL value, it will print the rule name, beta, h, update count, and\n"
		"RL value.\n"
		"\n"
		"Note that DBD is a different feature than \"meta\". Meta determines whether\n"
		"metadata about a production is stored in its header string. If meta is on and\n"
		"DBD is on, then each rule's beta and h values will be stored in the header\n"

		"  * Version --- The Soar version number, hostname, and date of the run.\n"
		"  * Number of productions --- The total number of productions loaded in the\n"
		"    system, including all chunks built during problem solving and all default\n"
		"    productions.\n"
		"  * Timing Information --- Might be quite detailed depending on the flags set\n"
		"    at compile time. See note on timers below.\n"
		"  * Decision Cycles --- The total number of decision cycles in the run and the\n"
		"    average time-per-decision-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"  * Elaboration cycles --- The total number of elaboration cycles that were\n"
		"    executed during the run, the average number of elaboration cycles per\n"
		"    decision cycle, and the average time-per-elaboration-cycle in milliseconds.\n"
		"    This is not the total number of production firings, as productions can fire\n"
		"    in parallel.\n"
		"  * Production Firings --- The total number of productions that were fired.\n"
		"  * Working Memory Changes --- This is the total number of changes to working\n"
		"    memory. This includes all additions and deletions from working memory. Also\n"
		"    prints the average match time.\n"
		"  * Working Memory Size --- This gives the current, mean and maximum number of\n"
		"    working memory elements.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --memory provides information about memory usage and Soar's\n"
		"memory pools, which are used to allocate space for the various data structures\n"
		"used in Soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The stats argument --rete provides information about node usage in the Rete\n"
		"net, the large data structure used for efficient matching in Soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The --max argument reports per-cycle maximum statistics for decision cycle\n"
		"time, working memory changes, and production fires. For example, if Soar runs\n"
		"for three cycles and there were 23 working memory changes in the first cycle,\n"
		"42 in the second, and 15 in the third, the --max argument would report the\n"
		"highest of these values (42) and what decision cycle that it occurred in (2nd).\n"
		"Statistics about the time spent executing the decision cycle and number of\n"
		"productions fired are also collected and reported by --max in this manner.\n"
		"--reset zeros out these statistics so that new maximums can be recorded for\n"
		"future runs. The numbers are also zeroed out with a call to init-soar.\n"
		"\n"
		"The --track argument starts tracking the same stats as the --max argument but\n"
		"records all data for each cycle instead of the maximum values. This data can be\n"
		"printed using the --cycle or --cycle-csv arguments. When printing the data with\n"
		"--cycle, it may be sorted using the --sort argument and a column integer. Use\n"
		"negative numbers for descending sort. Issue --stop-track to reset and clear\n"
		"this data.\n"
		"\n"
		"A Note on Timers \n"
		"\n"
		"The current implementation of Soar uses a number of timers to provide\n"
		"time-based statistics for use in the stats command calculations. These timers\n"
		"are:\n"
		"\n"
		"  * total CPU time\n"
		"  * total kernel time\n"
		"  * phase kernel time (per phase)\n"
		"  * phase callbacks time (per phase)\n"
		"  * input function time\n"
		"  * output function time\n"
		"\n"
		"Total CPU time is calculated from the time a decision cycle (or number of\n"
		"decision cycles) is initiated until stopped. Kernel time is the time spent in\n"
		"core Soar functions. In this case, kernel time is defined as the all functions\n"
		"other than the execution of callbacks and the input and output functions. The\n"
		"total kernel timer is only stopped for these functions. The phase timers (for\n"
		"the kernel and callbacks) track the execution time for individual phases of the\n"
		"decision cycle (i.e., input phase, preference phase, working memory phase,\n"
		"output phase, and decision phase). Because there is overhead associated with\n"
		"turning these timers on and off, the actual kernel time will always be greater\n"
		"than the derived kernel time (i.e., the sum of all the phase kernel timers).\n"
		"Similarly, the total CPU time will always be greater than the derived total\n"
		"(the sum of the other timers) because the overhead of turning these timers on\n"
		"and off is included in the total CPU time. In general, the times reported by\n"
		"the single timers should always be greater than than the corresponding derived\n"
		"time. Additionally, as execution time increases, the difference between these\n"
		"two values will also increase. For those concerned about the performance cost\n"
		"of the timers, all the run time timing calculations can be compiled out of the\n"
		"code by defining NO_TIMING_STUFF (in soarkernel.h) before compilation.\n"

		"\n"
		"The watch command controls the amount of information that is printed out as\n"
		"Soar runs. The basic functionality of this command is to trace various levels\n"
		"of information about Soar's internal workings. The higher the level, the more\n"
		"information is printed as Soar runs. At the lowest setting, 0 (--none), nothing\n"
		"is printed. The levels are cumulative, so that each successive level prints the\n"
		"information from the previous level as well as some additional information. The\n"
		"default setting for the level is 1, (--decisions).\n"
		"\n"
		"The numerical arguments inclusively turn on all levels up to the number\n"
		"specified. To use numerical arguments to turn off a level, specify a number\n"
		"which is less than the level to be turned off. For instance, to turn off\n"

		"provided for shorthand convenience. For more detailed control over the watch\n"
		"settings, the named arguments should be used.\n"

		"With no arguments, this command prints information about the current watch\n"
		"status, i.e., the values of each parameter.\n"
